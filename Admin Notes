kolibri manage listchannels

Import Channels from Internet
To import channels from Internet, run these two commands in sequence. The first downloads the channel database, and the second downloads the resources (videos, documents, etc.).

kolibri manage importchannel network <Channel ID>
kolibri manage importcontent network <Channel ID>
For example (Channel ID without angle brackets <...>):

kolibri manage importchannel network a9b25ac9814742c883ce1b0579448337
kolibri manage importcontent network a9b25ac9814742c883ce1b0579448337
Warning

When you import channels from the command line, you still must use the 32 digit channel ID, as the command will not work with the token. Make sure to receive the correct channel ID from the person who curated the unlisted channel you need to import, or refer to Kolibri Studio user guide how to find it in Studio user interface, if you have channel editor access
